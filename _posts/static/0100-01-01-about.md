title: "What's a #BirthdaySprint?"
---

On August 10th, 2013 there will be birthday celebrations around the world for OpenStreetMap's 9th birthday. In order to celebrate, we've decided to hold a distributed code sprint during the birthday weekend. What this means is that anyone with an OSM software project can rally their community to do a dedicated push over those two days. Our goal is to energize developers around the project's anniversary. 

The following projects will be participating-- feel free to add yours!

## OSM Groups

* Description: We are pushing to get the Groups Feature ready for an initial launch!
* Issues: This wiki page has gathered the needs https://github.com/osmlab/openstreetmap-website/wiki/Groups. Also, we label issues related to the groups branch with 'groups': https://github.com/osmlab/openstreetmap-website/issues?labels=groups&page=1&state=open 
* Code: The groups sketch tree is where we're working https://github.com/osmlab/openstreetmap-website/tree/groups-sketch
* We have a live instance here that has the working functionality: http://groups.apis.dev.openstreetmap.org/ - you need a separate account on the dev instance to gain access to all functionality. See a sample group here: http://groups.apis.dev.openstreetmap.org/groups/2
